Hello!


This repository is part of my journey into learning IT and technology. Here, I upload files, scripts, and notes I create while studying and experimenting. It's a personal space to track my progress, try out new things, and build my skills step by step.

Feel free to explore, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any tips or suggestions!
